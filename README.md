# Banking Investment tool 

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project is a investment tool that lets you input your inital investment (deposit) , how much you would like to invest in a month, the annual interest percentage you choose and the amount of years you wish to invest for. This tool is a helpful guide for anybody trying to save money and wanting to know exact amount of investments per year. 

# What did you do particularly well?
The piece of code that i wrote for the compound interest is accurate.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would like to enhance the main function due to the initialization, when the code is compiled it shows a 0 after the prompts.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 
The most challenging part of the code was the main function, im still unsure why my code prompts a 0 after the input prompts. 
 
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Skill from my code that are transferable are the calculations of monthly desposits and the calculations of the compound interest.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used spacing and inline comments to help understand what each functions are doing when ran as a program.
